## What are branches? Why use them?

Branching is one of Git’s most powerful features. It allows you to create a separate workspace where you can experiment, develop new features, or fix bugs without affecting the main project.

From the official Git [documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell):

> “Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.”

With branches, you can:

- [x] Work on new features without disrupting the stable version of your project.
- [x] Fix bugs without interfering with ongoing development.

- [x] Experiment safely, knowing you can switch back to a previous state anytime.

To list existing branch you can execute:

```sh
git branch
```

You can also check the branches on the remote with:

```sh
git branch -r
```

Or view all branches from local and remote:

```sh
git branch -a
```

## Creating and switching branches (git branch, git checkout, git switch)

### Creating new branch

To create a new branch the command is :

```sh
git branch feature
```

This creates a new branch called feature, but you will remain on your current branch.

To create a branch and switch to it directly:

```sh
git checkout -b feature
```

And this is the modern alternative to checkout:

```sh
git switch -c feature
```

### Switching to existing branch

To move between branches:

```sh
git checkout feature
```

Or using the modern way

```sh
git switch feature
```

## Merging branches (git merge)

Once your feature is complete, you’ll want to integrate it into the main line of development (typically the **main** or **develop** branch). Merging allows you to combine changes from different branches into a single branch.

### Steps to Merge a Branch

1 - Switch to the target branch (usually main or develop):

```sh
git switch main
```

2 - Merge the feature branch into the current branch:

```sh
git merge feature
```

If the branches have diverged significantly, Git might encounter merge conflicts. In that case, you'll need to manually resolve conflicts before completing the merge.

## Deleting branches

After merging your changes into the main branch, the feature branch is no longer needed and can be deleted to keep your repository clean.

### Delete local branch

To delete a local branch after merging:

```sh
git branch -d feature
```

However, if the branch contains unmerged changes, Git will prevent its deletion to avoid accidental data loss. If you are sure you want to forcefully delete the branch:

```sh
git branch -D feature
```

### Deleting a remote branch

If you want to delete a branch on the remote you can execute:

```sh
git push origin --delete feature
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```sh
git fetch -p  # Prune deleted remote branches from local references
```

This helps keep your local references clean after deleting remote branches.
