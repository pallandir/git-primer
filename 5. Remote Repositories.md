## Connecting to a remote (git remote add)

To work with a remote repository, Git needs to know where your code is hosted. You can configure one or more remote URLs in your repository. Each remote is assigned an alias to reference it easily instead of using the full URL.

### Adding a remote

To add a remote to a repository:

```sh
git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>
```

- _remote-name_ is the alias for the remote (default: `origin`).
- _remote-url_ is the actual URL of the repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

Example:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repository.git
```

### Updating a Remote URL

If the remote repositoryâ€™s URL changes (e.g., after migrating to another platform), update it using:

```sh
git remote set-url <remotee-name> <remote-url>
```

Example:

```sh
git remote set-url origin https://gitlab.com/user/repository.git
```

### Renaming a remote

If you need to rename a remote you can run:

```sh
git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>
```

Exemple:

```sh
git remote rename origin upstream
```

### Removing a Remote

To remove a remote from your repository:

```sh
git remote remove <remoete-name>
```

Exemple :

```sh
git remote remove origin
```

### Listing All Remotes

To view all configured remotes:

```sh
git remote -v
```

This will display the remote names and their corresponding URLs.

## Pushing changes (git push)

### Basic Usage

If you remember from Chapter 3: [basic Git workflows](3.%20Basic%20Git%20Workflow.md), until you push your code to the **remote repository**, it remains in your **local repository** and is only visible to you. To make your changes available to others, you need to use the push command:
To push your current branch to the remote repository, run:

```sh
git push
```

By default, this will push your branch to its configured upstream branch (if one exists). If your branch has no upstream counterpart, Git will return an error:

```sh
fatal: The current branch <branch-name> has no upstream branch.
```

To explicitly specify the remote branch, use:

```sh
git push origin <branch-name>
```

This ensures that your local branch is pushed to the remote repository under the same name.

### When to use git push and git push origin 'branch'

While git push assumes the current branch and default remote (origin), there are cases where specifying the remote explicitly is necessary:

- Multiple remotes: If your repository has more than one remote, you must specify the correct one (e.g., git push upstream main).
- Pushing to a different branch name: If you need to push a local branch under a different name on the remote, use:
- Using additional flags: Certain options like --delete require explicitly specifying the remote:

```sh
git push origin --delete feature-branch
```

Here is a recap:

| Command                       | Behavior                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git push`                    | Pushes the current branch to its upstream branch (if set). If no upstream exists, it will return an error.                 |
| `git push origin`             | Pushes the current branch to a remote branch **with the same name** in `origin`. If no remote branch exists, it will fail. |
| `git push origin <branch>`    | Pushes the specified branch to `origin`, regardless of the current checked-out branch.                                     |
| `git push -u origin <branch>` | Pushes the branch and **sets it as the upstream branch** (so future `git push` commands will work without specifying it).  |

### Git push flags

When pushing your code, you may need to perform additional actions beyond simply submitting changes. Git provides various flags to customize the git push command. Below is a summary of the most commonly used ones:

| Flag                    | Description                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-u` / `--set-upstream` | Sets the upstream branch for the current branch (e.g., `git push -u origin main`). |
| `--force` / `-f`        | Forces the push, rewriting history if necessary (**Use with caution!**).           |
| `--force-with-lease`    | Safer alternative to `--force`, ensuring no one else has pushed changes.           |
| `--delete`              | Deletes a branch from the remote (e.g., `git push origin --delete feature`).       |
| `--all`                 | Pushes all local branches to the remote.                                           |
| `--tags`                | Pushes all local tags to the remote repository.                                    |

## Fetching changes (git fetch)

Synchronizing your local repository with the remote one is crucial in Git. It ensures that your changes are submitted to others, while also allowing you to pull in changes from other contributors to stay up-to-date with the latest version of your project. Now that you know how to push your changes, let's cover how to fetch the changes made by others.

The process to fetch changes involves two main steps:

- Get the latest content from the remote repository into your local repository.
- Merge the fetched content into your current active branch.

The most basic set of commands to achieve this is:

```sh
git fetch origin <branch>
```

This command downloads the latest changes from the remote repository into your local machine without merging them. This allows you to inspect the updates before integrating them into your own work.

Once you're ready to merge the fetched content into your active branch, run:

```sh
git merge origin/<branch-name>
```

This will bring in the updates from the remote branch and apply them to your current working branch. It's always a good idea to make sure your working directory is clean (i.e., no uncommitted changes) before performing a merge to avoid conflicts.

## Pulling updates (git pull)

## Forking and contributing to open-source projects
