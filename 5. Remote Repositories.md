## Connecting to a remote (git remote add)

To work with a remote repository, Git needs to know where your code is hosted. You can configure one or more remote URLs in your repository. Each remote is assigned an alias to reference it easily instead of using the full URL.

### Adding a remote

To add a remote to a repository:

```sh
git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>
```

- _remote-name_ is the alias for the remote (default: `origin`).
- _remote-url_ is the actual URL of the repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

Example:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repository.git
```

### Updating a Remote URL

If the remote repositoryâ€™s URL changes (e.g., after migrating to another platform), update it using:

```sh
git remote set-url <remotee-name> <remote-url>
```

Example:

```sh
git remote set-url origin https://gitlab.com/user/repository.git
```

### Renaming a remote

If you need to rename a remote you can run:

```sh
git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>
```

Exemple:

```sh
git remote rename origin upstream
```

### Removing a Remote

To remove a remote from your repository:

```sh
git remote remove <remoete-name>
```

Exemple :

```sh
git remote remove origin
```

### Listing All Remotes

To view all configured remotes:

```sh
git remote -v
```

This will display the remote names and their corresponding URLs.
