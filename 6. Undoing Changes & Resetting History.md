## Discarding local changes (git restore, git checkout)

There will be times when you need to reset your working directory to a clean state. Whether it's due to mistakes or a need to abandon changes, Git provides several commands to help you manage this cleanup.

One of the primary commands you'll use is git restore. This command was introduced as a cleaner and safer alternative to git reset, and it can be applied to both your working directory and staging area.

To discard changes in your working directory, you can run:

```sh
git restore .
```

This command will revert all modified and deleted files in the working directory to their last committed state. However, it will not affect the staging area—the zone where changes are prepared for committing.

If you only want to **unstage** files (i.e., move them from the staging area back to the working directory), use:

```sh
git restore --staged <file>
```

Or if you need to reset the whole directory:

```sh
git restore --staged .
```

To restore all files in both the staging area and the working directory to their state in the last commit, run:

```sh
git restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree .
```

Sometimes, you might accidentally delete a file and want to restore it. You can easily retrieve the file from the latest commit using:

### Use case to using restore

You can choose to restore file that you previously deleted while still needing them in fact

```sh
git restore --source=HEAD <deleted-file>
```

> Remember, HEAD is a pointer to the latest commit on the active branch. By plaging with it you are able to move through commits history and thus project version.

> If you deleted a file but didn’t commit that deletion, git restore will bring back the file from the last commit, but if you already committed the deletion, you'd need to use git restore as described or recover from other commits where the file existed.

## Unstaging files (git reset HEAD)

The best way in the latests versions of Git to unstage files is to use the `git restore --staged .` command

However this is also another command `reset` that is older. This one can be quite confusing because it's not alway explicinting what is being reset.

To reset a staged file you can run

```sh
git reset <file>
```

If you need to reset all staged files you can run:

```sh
git reset
```

This will reset all your files from your staging area but your changes will still be there (You will not loose your code)

### Reset --soft and --hard

When you need to undo a recent commit, there are different options available depending on whether you want to keep or discard the changes. In most cases, you’ll want to reset your recent commit to either amend the commit message or because the content wasn’t ready, but still keep your staged files and local changes. In other words, you want to reset only the commit history.

To do this, you can use the following command:

```sh
git reset --soft HEAD~
```

This command is elegant because it moves your HEAD back by one commit (i.e., resetting the erroneous commit you just made) while keeping your changes intact. Your working directory and staging area remain as they were, so you can modify the files or update the commit message before making a new commit.

> the ~ operator is the short hand for ~1 which indicates Git that you want to point one commit back in time, if you used ~2 you would move your HEAD by 2 commits.

If you need to reset your latest commit and discard all changes made since then (for example, to undo an erroneous merge), you can use:

```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~
```

This will move your HEAD back by one commit and completely discard all changes in both the working directory and the staging area since that commit. Warning: You will lose any uncommitted changes, so be sure you really want to discard everything made after that commit.

## Amending commits (git commit --amend)

Sometimes, you don’t need to reset an entire commit just to fix a mistake. When you want to change a commit message or add a missing file, there’s no need to reset the entire commit history. Git provides a command for this called --amend.

If you run:

```sh
git commit --amend
```

This will allow you to edit your latest commit message. For example, you can fix a typo or adjust the commit message to be more accurate.

If you need to add or remove a file from the commit, follow these steps:

1. Add the missing file:

```sh
git add <file>
```

2. Or, remove a file:

```sh
git rm <file>
```

3. Then, run the following to amend the commit without changing the message:

```sh
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

The --no-edit flag tells Git that you don’t want to modify the commit message. Instead, it will update the commit to include the added or removed files.

The --amend command effectively rewrites the latest commit. It replaces the old commit in the history with the newly amended one. This means the original commit will no longer be visible after you amend it.

> Important: Amending commits rewrites history, so be cautious if the commit has already been pushed to a shared remote repository. It’s best to amend commits only when they haven't been shared with others yet.

## Reverting commits (git revert)

## Reset vs. Revert vs. Checkout
