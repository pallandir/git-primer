## Using submodules (git submodule)

Git submodules allow you to include another repository within your current project. This is useful when integrating external libraries or dependencies that are maintained separately but are required in your project.

### Adding a submodule to your project

To add a submodule to your project, run the following command:

```sh
git submodule add <submodule-url>
```

This adds the specified repository as a submodule, making it available within your project. You can then use its code, such as calling functions from the included repository.

### Updating a submodule

Since a submodule is an independent repository, it may receive updates over time. To fetch the latest changes, navigate to the submoduleâ€™s directory and run:

```sh
git pull origin <main-branch>
```

This updates the submodule to the latest version from its remote repository.
