## Using submodules (git submodule)

Git submodules allow you to include another repository within your current project. This is useful when integrating external libraries or dependencies that are maintained separately but are required in your project.

### Adding a submodule to your project

To add a submodule to your project, run the following command:

```sh
git submodule add <submodule-url>
```

This adds the specified repository as a submodule, making it available within your project. You can then use its code, such as calling functions from the included repository.

### Updating a submodule

Since a submodule is an independent repository, it may receive updates over time. To fetch the latest changes, navigate to the submodule’s directory and run:

```sh
git pull origin <main-branch>
```

This updates the submodule to the latest version from its remote repository.

### Pros and cons of submodules

Using Git submodules has several advantages:

✅ Keeps dependencies separate: Each submodule remains an independent Git repository, maintaining its own history and versioning.

✅ Prevents unwanted updates: Since submodules are locked to a specific commit, your project won’t break due to upstream changes.

✅ Reduces duplication: Shared libraries can be reused across multiple projects without copying files.

However, submodules also come with some challenges:

❌ Complex workflows: Updating a submodule requires committing and pushing changes in the submodule first, then updating and committing the reference in the main project, since Git tracks submodules at a specific commit.

❌ Easy to forget updates: Developers must manually update submodules, which can lead to inconsistencies.

❌ Cloning issues: When cloning a repository with submodules, users need to run

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

to ensure all dependencies are properly fetched.

While submodules are great for keeping external dependencies organized, they can be tricky to manage. If your project relies on frequent updates to shared code, using a package manager might be a smoother and less hassle-prone option.

## Handling large files with Git LFS

When working on projects that involve large files, such as big datasets or media assets, you might run into file size limits imposed by your remote repository hosting platform. To address this, Git provides Large File Storage (LFS), a system designed to handle large files efficiently without bloating your repository.
