## The Git object model (blobs, trees, commits)

From this point on, we’ll dive into more advanced Git concepts. If you need more time, feel free to review Chapters 1 to 6 before proceeding.

The beauty of Git lies in its ability to handle complex operations while maintaining a simple core. At its foundation, Git relies on objects to store and manage data. These objects are:

- Blob
- Tree
- Commit
- Tag

### Understanding Git Objects

Every Git object consists of three elements:

- Type: The type of object (blob, tree, commit, or tag).
- Size: The size of the object’s content.
- Content: The actual data stored in the object.

Each object plays a distinct role in how Git manages your project’s history:

- Blob (Binary Large Object):

  - Stores the content of a file.
  - Does not track filenames or directory structure—only the file’s data.

- Tree:

  - Represents a directory.
  - Contains references to blobs (files) and other trees (subdirectories).

- Commit:
  - Points to a specific tree, representing the project’s state at a certain moment.
  - Includes metadata like author, timestamp, and references to parent commits.

Tag:

- Marks a specific commit as important, typically for releases (e.g., v1.0.0).
- Can be lightweight (a simple pointer) or annotated (with additional metadata).

## Git references (HEAD, refs, tags)
