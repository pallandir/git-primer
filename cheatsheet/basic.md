## Init a project

In order for git to track your project you have to initialize a new git repository either locally and then push it or from an existing remote repository that you will be updating.
For that you can :

```shell
git init
# Init a project directory as a new git repository (local)
```

or

```shell
git clone [remote-url]
# Get an existing repository from a remote host to your local machine
```

## Setup branches

While working on your project you will add new feature and want to test them. For this you can create multiple branches, from scratch or from already existing branches.
here are some useful commands :

```shell
git clone [remote-url]
# Get an existing repository from a remote host to your local machine
```

```shell
git clone [remote-url]
# Get an existing repository from a remote host to your local machine
```

```shell
git clone [remote-url]
# Get an existing repository from a remote host to your local machine
```

```shell
git clone [remote-url]
# Get an existing repository from a remote host to your local machine
```

## Staging area

git is organized around three main area :

<details>
    <summary>The working area</summary>
    In the `working area` lives all your files that are untracked by git. Any changes made here and not explicitely marked to be tracked by git can be lost and will surely not be commited and pushed to your remote.
