## What is Git? Why use it?

Git is a powerful tool designed to manage versions of a same content, whether it’s code, articles, or entire projects. In any project, nothing is ever set in stone things evolve, and with evolution comes the possibility of mistakes.
It’s quite common to need to revert to a previous version to understand the origin of a bug, fix a typo or error, or recover something accidentally deleted. This is where Git comes in. It offers a comprehensive set of tools to manage these tasks effectively.
Git is primarily accessed through a command-line interface (CLI), which provides powerful functionality, though many user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have emerged to make Git even more accessible.

## Difference between Git and GitHub or GitLab

It’s important to distinguish Git from platforms like GitHub and GitLab. Git is the actual version control tool that manages your project locally and allows for distributed collaboration, while GitHub and GitLab are platforms built on top of Git.
These platforms provide centralized repositories to store and share your Git projects, collaborative tools for team communication and code reviews, and user-friendly interfaces to interact with Git. While GitHub or GitLab enhances your Git experience, they are not required to use Git, as Git can function independently, but these platforms need Git as their foundation. Combining Git with platforms like GitHub or GitLab offers several advantages, such as ease of sharing projects with teammates or the broader community, seamless team collaboration with task assignments and issue tracking, backup and accessibility of your projects from anywhere via remote repositories, and additional tools like CI/CD pipelines, code analysis, and deployment automation. Git is the backbone of modern version control, enabling teams to work efficiently and safeguard their projects, while platforms like GitHub and GitLab extend Git’s capabilities by providing tools for collaboration, project management, and remote accessibility.

## Installing Git (Windows, macOS, Linux)

To install Git according to your work environment please refer to this documentation : [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Basic Git configuration (git config)

When starting a new project with Git, you need to configure some general information. This information will be used for every commit and any operation that requires an author as metadata.

To configure your user details in Git, run the following commands:

```sh
## Set your name
git config --global user.name "firstname lastname"
```

```sh
## Set your email
git config --global user.email "your email"
```

These settings are stored globally, meaning they apply to all repositories on your system. If you want to set them for a specific repository only, omit the --global flag:

```sh
## Set user details for the current repository only
git config user.name "firstname lastname"
git config user.email "your email"
```

You can verify your configuration with:

```sh
git config --list
```

This will display all your current Git configurations.

There are multiple commands that can help you configure Git to suit your workflow. You can refer to the official documentation for a full list of options:
[Git config documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)

## Example .git/config File

After setting up your configurations, your .git/config file might look like this:

```ini
[user]
        name = John Doe
        email = john.doe@example.com

[core]
        editor = nano
        autocrlf = input

[alias]
        co = checkout
        br = branch
        ci = commit
        st = status
        lg = log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit

[push]
        default = simple

[pull]
        rebase = false

[color]
        ui = true
```
