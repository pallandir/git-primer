## Why Git, what is Git

Git is a powerful tool designed to manage versions of a same content, whether it’s code, articles, or entire projects. In any project, nothing is ever set in stone things evolve, and with evolution comes the possibility of mistakes.
It’s quite common to need to revert to a previous version to understand the origin of a bug, fix a typo or error, or recover something accidentally deleted. This is where Git comes in. It offers a comprehensive set of tools to manage these tasks effectively.
Git is primarily accessed through a command-line interface (CLI), which provides powerful functionality, though many user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have emerged to make Git even more accessible.

## Difference between Git and GitHub or GitLab

It’s important to distinguish Git from platforms like GitHub and GitLab. Git is the actual version control tool that manages your project locally and allows for distributed collaboration, while GitHub and GitLab are platforms built on top of Git.
These platforms provide centralized repositories to store and share your Git projects, collaborative tools for team communication and code reviews, and user-friendly interfaces to interact with Git. While GitHub or GitLab enhances your Git experience, they are not required to use Git, as Git can function independently, but these platforms need Git as their foundation. Combining Git with platforms like GitHub or GitLab offers several advantages, such as ease of sharing projects with teammates or the broader community, seamless team collaboration with task assignments and issue tracking, backup and accessibility of your projects from anywhere via remote repositories, and additional tools like CI/CD pipelines, code analysis, and deployment automation. Git is the backbone of modern version control, enabling teams to work efficiently and safeguard their projects, while platforms like GitHub and GitLab extend Git’s capabilities by providing tools for collaboration, project management, and remote accessibility.
