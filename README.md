<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About This 101

In professional development and large team projects, developers will inevitably rely on Version Control Systems (VCS). While these tools are powerful and significantly enhance productivity, their extensive features can sometimes feel overwhelming or intimidating.

This 101 guide serves as an introduction to Git commands, covering both beginner and advanced topics. Our goal is to help you feel confident and at ease when initializing, updating, or resolving conflicts in a project—showing that Git is neither as complex nor as daunting as it may seem.

Each command and scenario is detailed in a comprehensive cheat sheet, complete with examples and illustrations for clarity.
